    \frametitle{Introduction}
    "By leveraging the unique properties of quantum systems,
    such as superposition and entanglement, QML techniques have the potential to improve traditional
    methodologies in finance. These techniques promise to enhance predictive capabilities in areas such
    as portfolio optimization, market prediction, trading, pricing, and risk management"

    \begin{block}{Objective}
        Build an investment portfolio that maximizes returns while minimizing risk. To achive this, we need to choose carefully the option of assets such as
        stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments. The key is diversification, which means spreading investments across different assets that has \textbf{little to no correlation} to minimize risk and domino effect.
